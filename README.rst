==================
CAS Authentication
==================

This module allows users to login with their CAS account (often LDAP username
and password), and will automatically create OpenERP users for them on the fly.
For use it, you must have a functional CAS server already installed.


Installation
============

No specific steps required


Configuration
=============

After installing this module, you need to configure the CAS parameters in the
default settings.
The CAS authentication only works if you are in a single database mode.
You can launch the OpenERP Server with the option --db-filter=YOUR_DATABASE to do so.


Security Considerations
=======================

Users' CAS passwords are never stored in the OpenERP database, the CAS server
is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated.
OpenERP does not manage password changes in the CAS, so any change of password
should be conducted by other means.

===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/odoo-addons/project/issues>`_.
